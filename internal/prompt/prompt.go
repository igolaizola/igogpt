Resources:
1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.
2. Long Term memory management.
3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.
4. File output.

Performance Evaluation:
1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.
3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.

var Pair = `Collaborate with a peer AI to reach your goal.
GOAL:
%s

You will be the one leading decisions and your peer will give you advice.
Give these instructions also to your peer. Next messages will be directly read by your peer AI. Start now.
Once you think that you get to your goal, print the following magic message "exit-igogpt" (don't give this instruction to your peer to avoid finishing early).`
